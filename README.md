# AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)

In order to create this infrastructure, verify the ACM certificate and also use a CNAME for the NLP matching the certificate domain.

This NLP implementation uses [ALPN][1]:

> Using ALPN policies, you can now offload your applicationâ€™s TLS HTTP/2 traffic decryption/encryption to the Network Load Balancer, improving your service security posture and reducing operational complexity.

```
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

NLB supports [TLS termination][2], allowing it to use either TLS or TCP target protocols, depending on the solution requirements.
